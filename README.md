# BuzzwordsAnalyzer
Statistics about texts with occurrence of buzzwords. The prototype takes only the term "AI" as buzzword.
## Data
- https://www.kaggle.com/quora/question-pairs-dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/medium-articles
## Current Results
I couldn't find any similarities inside the clusters. The simplification of 2 component PCA from 300 features might be too large.
